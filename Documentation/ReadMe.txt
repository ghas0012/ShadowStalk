ShadowStalk User Guide

Important Note:

    Currently, we are facing a problem where our players will fall through the floor on initial spawn. This is caused by the player spawning before the level has had a chance to fully generate. This only happens when you load into the game through the Main Menu first, but it doesn't always happen.

    If it keeps happening, switch to Maps/MainMap_Hospital/MapTest and play from there.

ShadowStalk How-To:

    ShadowStalk is a heavily stylized asymmetrical co-op horror game where the players must work together to gather keys with the goal of escaping the confines of Limbo, while avoiding the grasp of the Monster. Keys will randomly spawn around the map and once a set amount have been collected, a randomly designated exit door will open, granting them a chance to escape and win the round.

    The Monster can stop a Shade from escaping Limbo by attacking them a total of 2 times, followed by a successful execution. If the Monster has killed all Shades, then it wins the round.

Gameplay Features:

    - Randomized Keys and Pickups.
    - Randomized exit doors to be unlocked with keys.
    - Custom User Interface (made with C++/UMG).
    - Player characters with custom movement component.
    - Monster player attack and execution.
    - Player character animations.
