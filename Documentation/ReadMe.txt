ShadowStalk How-To:

ShadowStalk is a heavily stylized asymmetrical co-op horror game where the players must work together to gather keys with the goal of escaping the confines of Limbo, while avoiding the grasp of the Monster.

Keys will randomly spawn around the map and once a set amount have been collected, a randomly designated exit door will open, granting them a chance to escape and win the round.

The Monster can stop a Shade from escaping Limbo by attacking them a total of 2 times, at which point they will get downed. Downed shades can recover after 10 seconds if the monster has not proceeded to execute them.

The Monster can execute a downed shade. If the Monster has killed all Shades, then it wins the round.

The Monster can drop traps around the map that will temporarily prevent the Shade from moving for a few seconds if stepped on.
